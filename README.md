    Leveraging Relaxed Equilibrium by Lazy Transition for Sequence Modeling

I've changed the framework of UNIVERSAL this year. For now, lazy_transformer was based on previous framework. I will reimplement this work ASAP. 


However, you can still use the LT.py for your Universal Transformer/ Naive Transformer to implement Lazy Transformer.
